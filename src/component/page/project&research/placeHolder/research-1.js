            <h1>Growth optimization of Haematococcus pluvialis for astaxanthin and algal powder supplements</h1>
            <h2>12 July 2021 - BIO Engineering (Dr. Hangsak Huy)</h2>
            <p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Microalgae accumulate large quantities of intracellular proteins and numerous secondary metabolites and represent as a promising source of renewable nutrition (1). Among the commercial microalgal products, astaxanthin is known as a super anti-oxidant and health beneficial compound (2). Haematococcus pluvialis is the most important microalga that richly synthesizes astaxanthin. However, only &lt;1% of natural astaxanthin from H. pluvialis compared to its synthetic counterpart (&gt;95%) are commercialized (2). It may be due to the low productivity and biomass yields that are influenced by the multiple factors and remain to be optimized. Therefore, this research aims to optimize the growth condition and enhance productivity of astaxanthin in H. pluvialis.</p>
            <p><strong>The specific objectives of this research are:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To isolate and identify the novel and close-related microalgal strains to H. pluvialis from various freshwater bodies and to characterize the composition of cellular contents and fatty acids. The novel or close-related species might provide an optional source for astaxanthin and crude products. The bacteria that are associated with the microalgal culture will be also identified at genetic level and verified their growth influence on the microalgal growth and production.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To optimize the multiple factors that critically influence the growth of microalgae and astaxanthin accumulation including cultural media, carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) sources and C/N ratios, micronutrient supplements, light irradiation, temperature, pH, or nitrogen limitation. In addition, various plant hormones will also be tested for the synthesis of astaxanthin by analyzing the expression of genes involving the astaxanthin synthetic pathway.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To chemically mutate the microalgal strains and select the best clone that favor to grow in a stress induction and accumulate a higher astaxanthin levels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To cultivate the best strain or clone in a close bioreactor and small scale of indoor open-pool system. The crude biomass and astaxanthin will be extracted, analyzed and1.  	subjected for the test of their anti-oxidative activities using mammalian cell line, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, or oxidative test kits, and other biochemical tests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To set up a large-scale cultivation and harvest system for production and commercialization at Sokkimmanima Group Co. Ltd. The finding in this research will be transferred to the partner company and further develop and innovate with the assisting of the research team and/or future collaborators.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Haematococcus pluvialis shows variables in astaxanthin synthesis that range from 2 to 5% in aplanospore cell state depending on the environmental factors, nutritional stress, derivatives and plant hormones (2). To increase its concentration, various investigations are necessary. Therefore, we hypothesize that the growth of microalgae and enhancement of astaxanthin production can be achieved through the cultural optimization and genetic manipulation.
                To achieve these hypotheses, several specific objectives shall be implemented as the following. 1) To isolate, identify and characterize the novel microalgae, closed-related strains to or sub-strains of H. pluvialis and compare their cellular contents with the commercial strain, H. pluvialis UTEX 2505. 2) To optimize the growth condition including cultural media, micronutrient supplement, carbon-to-nitrogen sources and ratios, light irradiation, temperature, pH, or nitrogen limitation. 3) To analyze the impact on the algal growth and astaxanthin synthesis caused by the microalgal associated-bacteria and plant hormones. 4) To chemically induce mutation in some strains and selected the best grown and stress tolerated microalgae that barring higher astaxanthin content.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology</strong>: Multiple methodologies will be conducted. First, to collect microalgae from the freshwater sample, identify their morphologies and genetics using the microscopic and 18S rDNA sequencing. The associated bacteria will be confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The novel strains confirmed by sequencing will be further characterized. The growth and carotenoid accumulation in the isolates will be analyzed by cell counting and pigment reading. Second, to optimize the best growing medium, micronutrient supplements, C and N sources, C/N ratios, N limitation, and environmental conditions for the growth and carotenoid accumulation in the standard strain UTEX 2505 (3). The growth and carotenoids production from the isolate, UTEX 2505, and induced-mutant microalgae will be compared. The effect of associated-bacteria and several plant hormones such as abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, methyl jasmonate or growth regulators like gibberellic acid, salicylic acid or brassinosteroid-2,4-epibrassinolide on astaxanthin accumulation (2) will also be tested using real time (RT) qPCR amplification, cell counting method, and pigment analysis. Third, to induce the mutation in H. pluvialis using the chemical mutagen, N-methyl-NÂ­-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) (4, 5) and identify the best growth resistance under unfavorable growth conditions. Fourth, to extract and purify astaxanthin from the crude extract using the solvent base-extraction. The structure of astaxanthin will be analyzed by using NMR and HPLC. Fifth, compare the antioxidative activity of astaxanthin extracted from this study with the commercial counterpart using mammalian cell lines and anti-oxidative test kit. The expression of several antioxidant genes will also be confirmed by RT-qPCR amplification. </p>
            <p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: We expect to isolate various microalgal species that potentially produce astaxanthin and other valuable sources of nutrition. We also expect to identify novel species of bacteria that grow associated with microalgae and explore their influence on microalgal cultivation. The optimal growth condition, mutagenesis, and astaxanthin synthesis that will be discovered in this study will play an important protocol and fundamental knowledge toward the future development for large-scale production. Finally, these results will be published in the local or international journal.</p>
