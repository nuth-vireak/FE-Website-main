            <h1>Analyzing bioactive compounds of marine algae in developing of moisturizing, hypermimentation, and anti-aging cosmeceutical cream</h1>
            <h2>12 July 2021 - BIO Engineering (Dr. Solida Long)</h2>
            <p><strong>Introduction</strong>: The increasing of toiletry products in Cambodia is notable. Cambodian people tend to use the chemical mercury added cream for skin-whitening and block the formation of melanin [1] leading to kidney damage and neurological toxicity and skin disorders. Tones of fake cosmetics costed million dollars for Cambodian users [2]. Marine algae have been reported for their benefits for diverse skin disorders including pigmentation, skin aging, atopic dermatitis and skin carcinogenesis [3]. Marine algae along the coastal area of Cambodia have shown less interest in these applications. This research project will target to produce a cream/lotion with sun-blocking, antioxidant, and moisturizing functions. The main objectives is to extract and characterization of bioactive compounds from brown, red and green algae and produce a formulation of cream products potentially commercialized in Cambodia.</p>
            <p><strong>The specific objectives of this research are:</strong>
                <li>
                    To extract and purify small organic molecules including phenolic and non-phenolic compounds from brown, red, and green algae for a baseline analysis of bioactive compounds from marine sources.</li>
                <li>
                    To identify the structure of the extracted bioactive compounds using physical and chemical methods and evaluate their anti-aging properties (antioxidant, anti-melanogenesis, anti-aging, photo protective properties) in order to obtain a lead compound and establish structure activity relationships.            </li>
                <li>
                    To determine the formulation of cosmetical products-face and body cream/lotions, potential commercial products, in order to create a brand name of RUPP cosmetic products.            </li>
                <li>
                    To cultivate the best strain or clone in a close bioreactor and small scale of indoor open-pool system. The crude biomass and astaxanthin will be extracted, analyzed and1.  	subjected for the test of their anti-oxidative activities using mammalian cell line, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, or oxidative test kits, and other biochemical tests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To evaluate anti-aging, moisturizing, and anti-melanogenic activity in vivo study with collaboration of beauty Clinique.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: The selective algae would present huge number of saccharides and phenolic compounds with stress oxidation and photoprotective properties. Compounds of interest would be known and/or include new structures. Two types of emulsions creams/lotions would be successfully formulated with the lead compound to possess wide range of antioxidant, anti-melanogenesis, moisturizing effects both in vitro and in vivo test which is potentially patentable.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology</strong>: Different polarity solvents will be used for extraction and further purification using chromatography methods. Structure elucidation will include NMR spectroscopy and HPLC method will allow quantitative studies. Antioxidation properties will be conducted by DPPH, metal, hydroxy radical, and reducing power assays. UVA-UVB protection, anti-aging, anti-melanogenesis properties will be examined on HaCat and high expressing melanin cell lines. Cells viabilities will be examined using MTT assay. Type-1 pro-collagen and melanin contents, and expression of MMP-1 will be evaluated and confirmed by western blot assay.Tyrosinase, elastase assays also be included. Several types of day creams/lotions will be formulated by adding to the base formula of the algae â€˜extracts and/or isolated compound. The most active compound/fraction will be selected in development process. Cream characteristic like rheology, chemical and physical stability, oxidation stability, and phase separation stability, pH, color, smoothness, spread ability, conductivity will be also determined. Volunteers will be selected and tested of final products for 60 days. The skin characteristic-epidermal water loss, capacitance, firmness, sebum, and wrinkle will be evaluated by using skin testing machine.  The statistical analysis will be performed using ANNOVA analysis.</p>
            <p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: We expect that the extraction and purifications will render significant amount of bioactive compounds -carbohydrates and phenolic compounds with high anti-aging, anti-pigmentation, antioxidant, and anti-UV radiation with potential for skin application. We strongly expected that the cream/lotion will show excellent properties toward skin care problems leading to issue a patent and potentially commercialized which may create a whole new algae farming and related cosmetic industries in Cambodia. We expect to produce 3 masters, 6 undergraduate students under this project. We will become the baseline research group for cosmeceutical products in RUPP and Cambodia.</p>
