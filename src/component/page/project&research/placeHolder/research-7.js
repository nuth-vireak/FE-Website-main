            <h1>Gastromod: An interactive tool for 3D Gastropod Modeling</h1>
            <h2>Dec 2018 - Information Technology Engineering (KimAng Kheang, Sokchea Kor, and Sovila Srun) </h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This paper presents an interactive tool called Gastromod that allows the user to graphically approximate a number of diverse three dimensional ideal shapes of gastropods (snails with shells) developing isometric growth. The implementation uses (i) Raupâ€™s geometric model for constructing the spiral shape and (ii) the Frenet frame to orient generating curves such as circles or ellipses along the spiral curve. The ideal 3D surface of the shell of a gastropod or cephalopod (ammonite) is generated using typical parameters frequently measured in paleontology. In combination with 3D scans of fossils, this tool makes a contribution to assist paleontologists and other related researchers in the analysis of evolution and growth, the study of the possible shell forms and the revolution determination of gastropods.</p>
