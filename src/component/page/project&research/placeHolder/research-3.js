            <h1>Development of probiotic fermented vegetables in Cambodia and their effect on immunue system in vitro</h1>
            <h2>12 July 2021 - BIO Engineering (Ms. Huoy Laingsun)</h2>
            <p><strong>Introduction</strong>:Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been well documented as a good source for variety of fermented foods due to their ability to produce many active compounds as antimicrobial and as inducer for many white blood cells in epithelial of digestion system (Rhee et al., 2011; Arihara et al., 1996; Barefoot et al., 1983). The overall objective of this research aims to isolate and characterized good potential LAB from difference kind of fermented vegetable from urban local market in Cambodia.  In vitro testing will be conducted on specific macrophage cell line to evaluate their role in immune system. The compromise strains which show high ability as antimicrobial and immune modulator will be kept to use as a starter culture to adapt from small scale to large scale industry production. This mean that after the complete project, our team will develop at least one best fermented formula, the technique to store fermented food product for longer shelf life, and these formulas maybe use by our industrial partner for producing new product that fit with both local and maybe international market. In recent years, LAB have attracted significant attention because of their generally
                recognized as safe (GRAS) status in food production industry.</p>
            <p><strong>The specific objectives of this research are:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To characterize LAB from local fermented vegetable and startup culture growth conditions by using culture technique to isolate the LAB strain from fermented food and characterize strains by biochemical test.                </li>
                    <li>
                        To determine the inhibitory compounds such as bacteriocin and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production for stimulating effect on macrophage RAW 264.7 cells for TNF‐α, IL‐10, and nitrogen oxide (NO) production.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To set up fermented vegetable formula and develop the shelf-life quality of the final product.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Best fermented food formula will be shared to private sector partner for production development from small scale to large scale to meet the market requirement
            </p>
            <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: In our research we hypothesized that:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Local Cambodian fermented vegetable would contain many useful LAB strains that can be potential strains for apply as starter culture for future fermented food processing in industrial level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        LABs isolated would also provide the antimicrobial compound (such as bacteriocin and hydrogen peroxide) that can be used to stimulate RAW 264.7 cell line to produce TNF‐α, IL‐10, and nitrogen oxide (NO).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From survey study on tradition fermented formula and the application study of LABs in fermented food, Final unique fermented food formula will be set up with the optimum shelf-life quality for final fermented food product.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Methodology</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Isolation and characterization: LAB strains will be isolated from various fermented vegetable using culture method on Man, Rogosa and Sharp (MRS) agar and M17 agar, and then confirmed by gram stain method and biochemical test kit API 50 CHL.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Agar diffusion bioassay will be used for screening the bacteriocin production and Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua will be used as indicator organisms. Then the production of H2O2 from LAB will be determined using the colorimetric method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Total isolated LAB strains will be screened for activation of macrophage cell line for TNF‐α, IL‐10, and nitrogen oxide (NO) production by ELISA technique and Griess reaction; respectively. In brief, macrophage RAW 264.7, one of model cell line for the study of the immune system in vitro, will be cultured and stimulated by the LAB that have been characterized in (step 1) to see whether, Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), an immune stimulatory protein found on the cell wall LAB, could induce the production TNF‐α, IL‐10, and nitrogen oxide (NO) production. To determine the TNF‐α and IL‐10, the supernatant from culture will be collected and tested for the presence of TNF‐α and IL‐10 by using the specific antibodies for these 2 substances by ELISA reader. To determine the NO production, the supernatant of the stimulation culture will be test by using Griess reagent kit. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 540 nm on an automated EL800 plate reader
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        LAB with antimicrobial and immunological stimulation criteria will be test for optimum growth range of pH, salt bile, and temperature to clarify that those LABs still have function during the production scale up. Shortly, the isolated LAB will be inoculated to medium culture with pH range of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0, for the determination of the pH tolerant. Similarly, 0.1%,- 0.5% bile salts (w/v) will be supplemented with MRS broth for the investigation of bile salt concentration. Temperature 20, 37 and 44 °C were set up for incubation of LAB, to investigate whether LAB still function well when go through the digestive tract of human being.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The standard formula for industry production will be conducted base on the preference of the tastiest healthy individual. Two target groups of people; 30 individuals with fermented food as their favorite and another 30 people who do not really like the fermented food will include in this study for the sensory test of the developed product in order to get the data for the taste analysis whether it is acceptable. Once the product has been developed, the microbiological test will be done for the safety quality of the product such as Culturable microorganisms (22 0C and 370C), Total Coliforms, Escherichia coli, Intestinal Enterococci, Spore of sulfite reducing anaerobes and physico-chemical tested like Turbidity, pH, Chloride, Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, Hardness, and Iron will be conducted for measuring the final products shelf-life quality. In this step, the safety concern is taken in account before lunch the product to the customer. SPSS program will be used for the analysis in this study.

            <p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: We highly expect that via this project, we could isolate and characterize potential LAB from many vegetables fermented food to use as a starter for traditional Cambodian fermented food. Moreover, through this significant project, we hope to establish acceptable formula to transform the production of tradition fermented vegetable from family scale to proper packaging that meet the standard safety for the food level. This research outcome will also serve as literature reference for young researcher to develop their future research and cooperation with private company will be happened for the bring the final products to the local or oversea market in near future. Lastly, 1 article will be published in the peer review journal.</p>
