    intro:"This week at Bungie, we are heading to the lab. \n" +
    "\n" +
    "Tomorrow, we are kicking off our first Trials Labs. These experimental weekends will allow us to test out targeted changes to the game mode and collect data and feedback on what works and what should remain an abomination of science. In keeping with our Trials revamp this Season, we are sticking to our “test and learn” mindset not only with Labs, but also with matchmaking, rewards, and other quality of life improvements. \n" +

    "This week, the normal Trials of Osiris playlist is replaced with Trials Labs: Capture Zone. This new mode is still Elimination, with the following changes: \n" +
    "30 seconds after the round starts, a capture zone is enabled. Players can capture this zone to win the round – or just eliminate the other team like normal. \n" +
    "             -  The capture zone has a waypoint from round start, including a countdown timer, so everyone will know exactly when and where it will be. \n" +
    "The capture zone starts in the middle of the map in the first round and changes location each round. \n" +
    "            -  The team who just lost gets the advantaged spawn location. \n" +
    "\n" +
    "Also for this week, double Trials rank points for every match! If you are feeling the blues of Fabled and Mythic, this is a great week to reset! ",
