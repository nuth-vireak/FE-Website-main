    "summary": "The Biotechnology and Food Technology Master Program is designed for students who wish to study the application of biological, chemical, engineering, and physical principles to the conversion of raw agricultural products into processed foods suitable for human consumption, the nature of foods, the causes of deterioration, the principles underlying food processing, and the improvement of food quality and safety for public consumption. The Program intends to prepare engineers for life-long achievement through both education in Biotechnology, Food technology, and sustainable refining of natural products in Cambodia and also development of communication, teamwork, leadership and entrepreneurship skills.\n\nThe Biotechnology and Food Technology Master Program is one of the graduate study programs in the Department of Bio-Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Royal University of Phnom Penh. The study program has been evaluated and reviewed periodically. With this program, Department of Bioengineering of RUPP intends to develop partnerships with three different Swedish universities, the Swedish Agricultural University, Lund University, and Umeå University. The Department of Bioengineering at RUPP sees this as a clear possibility to create a stronger and more sustainable research group within the Faculty of Engineering. For researchers at all involved universities this represents a unique opportunity to form an interdisciplinary research team around challenging research issues of large human relevance.",
