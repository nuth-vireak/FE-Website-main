The areas of study in Bio-Engineering/Biotechnology are quite diverse. The curriculum is developed to provide fundamental knowledge in several major study areas so that students will be well prepared for work in biotechnical field such as food industry, microbial and enzyme biotechnology industry, gene technology, plant cell technology, etc., either in industrial factories, or in public and private research institutes. \n\n The Bio-Engineering/Biotechnology Program intends to prepare engineers for life-long achievement through both education in the principles of Bio-Engineering/Biotechnology and also development of communication, teamwork, leadership and entrepreneurship skills.",
