    "summary": "Bachelor of Information Technology Engineering (ITE) program at Faculty of Engineering, Royal University of Phnom Penh is designed to provide high-quality training in Information Technology which meets the current and future labor market requirements by emphasizing a broad foundation of computer organization, software, and mathematics both theoretical and practical aspects. With elective courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics, Game Development, Data Mining, and Security, it enables students to be capable to develop diverse industrial applications. At ITE, students are required to do practicum from year 2 to year 4 with real world problem. Doing practicum plays a crucial role in training students to acquire valuable experience required skill sets and ability to be ready for work at Tech Company after graduation.\n\nThe curriculum of Information Technology Engineering Department is designed for our students with abilities to use new technologies and theories to design and develop computer software. During first and second year, students study about foundation theories of computer software & network engineering. For third & forth year, they will have more advance courses such as Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Product Design, Network Engineering, Database Design, Operating System, Mobile Application Development, Artificial Intelligence, Commuter Graphic, and Practicum (to build a real product). From the end of third year students must go for internship in private or pubic organizations. Lecturers and Researchers of IT Engineering department mostly graduated from abroad, the key    success of our team is to give more homework/assignment/project to students, and let them hand on to build a real thing by applying technologies and theories. Thus, students in our department they will have experiences in team work, developing application, make presentation, and critical thinking.",
