    "summary": "\tTelecommunication and Electronics Engineering integrates two technologies including Telecommunication technology and Electrical technology. Telecommunication technology is the communication system over long distance by transmitting electrical signal via cable, propagating electromagnetic wave (wireless) or light signal, base on the fundamental of electricity and electronics. Electronics technology focuses on a design of integrated circuit with components such as diode, transistor, resistor, capacitor, sensors and other components in order to control electron flow (electricity). Our department provides quality education for students to be able to design system and devices in both technologies to solve social problems, to be able to conduct research, and to be able to continue to pursuit graduate studies. With our curriculum, students will be able to do group work effectively with leadership and entrepreneurship. After graduate from our program, students are qualified to work in mobile operation companies, Internet service providing companies, TV / Radio Stations, Airports/seaports, factories, and public/private institutions.",
